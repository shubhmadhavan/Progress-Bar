# Build
Note: The Releases section has the latest build uploaded. However, if one wishes to build locally. Simply download dependencies and build using the following:  
`pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=favicon.ico --add-data "sv_ttk;sv_ttk" progress_app.py`

## Support
I have nothing to plug here. Just keep working hard and making progress!
